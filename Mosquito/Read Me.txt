The following are trader files for the RwG Addon Mosquito Series by [HG]RaVeN103. 
This is more specifically for the Exile Easy Trader Mod System found at:
https://github.com/redned70/Trader-Mod

1. Add the MOSQUITO folder to the TRADERS folder in your MP mission.

2. In the TRADERS folder find the CfgTraders.hpp file and add:
   "Mosquito", to the class Exile_Trader_Aircraft section. See the example below:
   
   	class Exile_Trader_Aircraft
	{
		name = "AIRCRAFT";
		showWeaponFilter = 0;
		categories[] = 
		{
            "Mosquito",
			"Choppers",
			"RHSChoppers",
			"A3unarmedChoppers",
			"A3armedChoppers",
			"CUPChoppers",
			"CUPPlanes",
			"Planes",
			"A3Planes",
			"RHSPlanes"
		};
	};
	
3. Find and open the config.cpp file in your MP Mission folder and add:
   
   #include "TRADERS\MOSQUITO\ItemListMOSQUITO.hpp"
   
   to the class CfgExileArsenal section.
   
4. Also in the config.cpp file add:

   #include "TRADERS\MOSQUITO\TraderCategoriesMOSQUITO.hpp"
   
   to the class CfgTraderCategories section.
   
Also I have added the Mosquito to the XM8. I use Infistars version, see below:

class customapp_5 {
	submenu = 0;
	toggleable = 0;
	text = "Deploy Gyro";
	tooltip = "Deploys a gyro right infront of you, once per life!";
	fnc = "['RwG_Mozzie_Carl_Exile', '', 0, 0, false, true, false] call apps_fnc_deploy;"; // [class, itemcost (empty '' - no item cost), poptabs from bank, respect, has to be bambi, can repack, once per life?]
	pic = "\A3\air_f\Heli_Light_01\Data\UI\Heli_Light_01_CA.paa";
};

I simply replaced one of the donation apps with the above.  But I would recomend a better image for the app.
